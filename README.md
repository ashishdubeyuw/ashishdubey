## How can I deploy this project?

This repo is now configured to deploy to **GitHub Pages** using the workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` whenever you push to `main` or `master`.

1. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` or `master` (or run the workflow manually from the Actions tab).
4. Open: `https://ashishdubeyuw.github.io/ashishdubey/` after the workflow finishes.

> This app auto-detects the repo name for production builds on GitHub Actions (`GITHUB_REPOSITORY`) and falls back to `/ashishdubey/`.
> You can override manually with `BASE_PATH=/your-repo/ npm run build`.

For local verification:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run preview
```
